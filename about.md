Hello world! I hope all is well with you! The purpose of this section is just to give you a brief idea of who I am and what I am like. First off, I am from Manhasset, NY on Long Island, and I am a graduate of Washington and Lee University in Lexington, VA (class of 2016), where I studied Neuroscience and played lacrosse. I love being active and I am utterly fascinated by the randomness of the world.

### More Information

So when I am not at my computer working on or thinking about data, I love to spend time outside. My activities of choice are lacrosse, skiing, golf, and surfing, and pretty much in that order. I've been playing lacrosse since I was 5 and am still completely absorbed by it (Manhasset is a bit of a lacrosse hotbed, to say the least. Think football in Texas...). I also love skiing and spending time in the mountains. Since skiing can't easily be done in the Summer, I picked up surfing about a year ago. The learning curve is real, but catching a long wave is an incredible feeling. I am undeniably hooked.

Now that you have an idea of the physical activities I enjoy, I'd like to give you a quick look into my mind. I am definitely an organized person. Always have been, always will be, probably (you never can be absolutely certain, can you?). I have always been interested in mathematics and numbers, perhaps because of their innate structure, but recently I have developed a rather strong interest in literature and language. Communication of ideas is an immensely powerful tool, and is one of the most essential features of humanity.

Welp, that's me, in brief. But if you would like to learn more feel free to contact me, or check out some of my work on github.
