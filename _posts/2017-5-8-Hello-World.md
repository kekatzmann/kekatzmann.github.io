What's up everyone! My name is Kevin Katzmann. Welcome to my blog! 

A little bit about myself and this blog:

I am a graduate of Washington and Lee University in Lexington, VA (class of 2016), where I studied Neuroscience and played Lacrosse. I absolutely love being active, and I am utterly fascinated by the randomness of the world. There. I know that wasn't much, but if you want  to learn more you can contact me via email, linkedin, or something else along those lines.

The purpose of this blog is to share some of my work and ideas with the world in order to express myself and contribute to the mountian of knowledge humans have acquired. I will be writing posts about projects I have done, concepts I have learned, and experiences I have... experienced, and hopefully I will do so with lucidity and creativity, two of my favorite things language allows us.

Welp, that's all I got for now. I hope you guys check back in soon! I am looking forward to starting this up! Also, [here](https://github.com/kekatzmann) is a link to my GitHub page. It's pretty cool. You should check it out.

Peace!
