What's up everyone! My name is Kevin Katzmann. Welcome to my blog! 

So, I think it would be wise for this post, being the first post I post, to give any new-comers an idea of what to expect. A foundation, or supports. It's sort of like post-supporting posts post. Pre all the other posts. Anyway...

The purpose of this blog is to share some of my work and ideas with the world in order to express myself and contribute to the mountian of knowledge humans have acquired, however large or small that contribution may be. I will be writing posts about projects I have done, concepts I have learned, and experiences I have... experienced, and hopefully I will do so with lucidity and creativity, two of my favorite things language allows us.

Welp, that's all I got for now. I hope you guys check back in soon! I am looking forward to starting this up! Also, [here](https://github.com/kekatzmann) is a link to my GitHub page. It's pretty cool. You should check it out.

Peace!
